# Database Final Project -- Harrison, Porter, and Josh

## Setting up:

Install the sole dependency by running:

`pip install termcolor`

Because this is a console/terminal-based app, we used this library to add color to print text.

## Running the app

Navigating this app is done by simple text-based menu interaction. 

Upon launching the app, users are prompted to login with their University of Saint Thomas email. No password is required. Signing in will only work if the "username" is 8 characters long (i.e. john1234) and the domain name is "@stthomas.edu".
