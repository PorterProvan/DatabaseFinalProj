## Running the app






This Lost and Found application is designed specifically for the University of St. Thomas community. Its primary goal is to provide a centralized platform where students can easily log and track lost items on campus. Users are required to log in using their UST email to ensure accountability and allow communication.

The system offers two functionalities: posting a lost item and claiming a found item.

This platform is designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind by minimizing unnecessary steps to ensure that users can efficiently assist each other in the spirit of good samaritanism.

### Set-Up for Grading

Use the 'config.py' file and fill the necessary information to run the program.
